        <h2 class="tribute section__title">Why Fortnite?</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info" class="tribute">Fortnite has taken the world by storm, with over 78 million monthly active users the game has exploded both in popularity and creativity. Fortnite is a competitive online shooter is continually evolving before our eyes. This page is dedicated to Forntite's impact on the gaming world.</p>
        <article class="tribute article">
          <h3 class="article__title">Business Model</h3>
          <p class="article__info">Freemium games have been around for a long time but never before has a freemium game gained such traction in the gaming world. Being free removes all blocks from user adoptment and the season pass along with the skins allow Epic to generate mass amounts of revenue continually.</p>

          <h3 class="article__title">Pushing the Envelope</h3>
          <p class="article__info">Most games when they reach this amount of popularity are afraid to change core features and functionality because they dont want to lose players. Those games peak and then fade as a result. Epic has displayed a level of courage unseen before with popular games and not only encourages creativity but also taking risks. This is a core component to their continued popularity. Sometimes their experiments are wildly successful, sometimes they are complete failures (Infinity Blade). They also have a wonderful sandbox to test new features in the form of other match types before moving the feature into Standard Battle Royale. But what is most important is that they continue to innovate and evolve the game.</p>

          <h3 class="article__title">Dragging Consoles into the Future</h3>
          <p class="article__info">For years console players have pushed for cross console online compatibility and the consoles have pushed back. No game had the leverage to force the consoles to allow a feature that would take away a key differentiator. Fortnite was able to leverage its popularity to break this barrier. They may be the only game currently with this capability but hopefully they won't be the last.</p>
